# Introduction

This project summary encompasses the several implementations of mine surrounding concise yet intuitive machine learning concepts. The data used for each implementation have been simplified for both computational runtime and general comprehension purposes, however their key variances have been preserved even in cases where some of the dimensions have been reduced drastically.

# k-Nearest Neighbor Classification and Statistical Estimation

We are considering a binary classification problem where the goal is to classify whether a person has an annual income more or less than $50,000 given census information.
